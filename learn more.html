      <p class="question">What are the consequences of climate change and other negative environmental changes?</p>
      <p class="answer">Global warming is the most obvious effect of climate change, and it has repercussions on many aspects of nature - for example, it leads to extreme heat waves, which increase heat-related illnesses, a higher frequency of wildfires, more severe natural disasters, increased drought and water scarcity, lessening food availability, and increasing sea level.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="question">What are the causes of climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction?</p>
      <p class="answer">Any activity that burns or runs on fossil fuels, like generating heat and electricity, manufacturing goods, and using transportation, contributes to increased CO2 emissions and, therefore, climate change. Furthermore, deforestation increases the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and contributes to habitat loss. Air pollution can come from car and truck exhaust, factory emissions, dust, and wildfires; water pollution comes from fuel spillages, chemical waste dumping, improper sewage disposal and rubbish dumping; and land pollution comes from littering, urbanization, and soil contamination.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="question">How do we know climate change is real and caused by human activity?</p>
      <p class="answer">An overwhelming body of evidence shows that temperature is increasing at rate that has much to do with the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere produced by the burning of fossil fuels to power industrial machines. We see the effects of climate change happening through the shrinking ice sheets and glaciers, the increase in droughts, floods, and wildfires, and more. We know climate change is caused by humans because scientists have determined that the greatest factor in current climate change is  rising greenhouse gas concentrations, which have increased in the past two centuries due to human activity.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="question">Who is affected by climate change, pollution, and and habitat destruction?</p>
      <p class="answer">All humans are affected, specifically those in developing countries that donâ€™t have the resources to fight against and recover from the effects of climate change. Factors like increased natural disasters, contaminated water and food, air pollution, and decreasing food sources and species diversity are all threats to human health. Furthermore, pollution harms animals through contaminated food and water sources and directly harms them through plastic pollution in oceans, while climate change and habitat destruction are contributing to a mass extinction.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="question">Why is it important that we take action to prevent climate change from worsening now?</p>
      <p class="answer">The effects of climate change are permanent and irreversible - once we cross a certain threshold for temperature, it will be extremely difficult and almost impossible for us to bring things back to normal. Permanent temperature changes also affect things like sea level and ecological factors that will do irreversible geological damage to the Earth.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="question">What is hindering governmental progress with climate action?</p>
      <p class="answer">Many governmental leaders refuse to take action against climate change and minimize the problem in favor of the prosperity of the oil and coal industries. However, it is possible to maintain economic growth and protect the jobs of those who work in the fossil fuel industries while working against climate change with agreements like the Green New Deal, a congressional resolution to convert to renewable energy while guaranteeing living-wage jobs for all.</p>
