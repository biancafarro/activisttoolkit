        <h1>EDUCATING AND EMPOWERING YOU TO TAKE ACTION FOR OUR PLANET.</h1>
        <p id="introPara">Our planet is currently experiencing a widespread environmental crisis due to human-caused climate change and abuse of natural  resources. The current environmental crisis not only affects the physical state of the planet, but also the organisms that live on it and their futures - some primary effects of climate change are loss of species diversity, food shortages, an increased number of severe storms, and widespread poverty and displacement. Our mission is to increase environmental awareness regarding climate change and sustainability and provide people like you with ways to get involved with environmentalism personally and systemically. </p>

          <p class="focusDesc">The current period of climate change has been occurring since the 1800s. Actions like the burning of fossil fuels, destruction of forests, and filling of landfills release greenhouse gases that are kept in the atmosphere where they trap heat from the sun, raising temperatures. Currently, greenhouse gas emissions are the highest they have been in 2 million years - this has disrupted our planet as sea levels have risen, natural disaster severity and frequency have increased, and species biodiversity have declined rapidly. </p>

          <img class="focusPictures" src="assets/pollution.jpg" alt="A bird's eye view of a factory plant emitting gases into the air and a small section of the surrounding town.">
          <p class="focusDesc">Pollution is another threat to the environment and human and animal health. It takes many forms, including air pollution, land pollution, and water pollution. Air pollution is mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels, wildfires, burning of garbage waste, industrial emission, and transportation (all of which have connections to climate change) while air and water pollution are caused by petroleum spills, chemical releases, and improperly disposed plastics. Legislation and personal sustainability are two of the main solutions to pollution. </p>

          <img class="focusPictures" src="assets/deforestation.jpg" alt="A forest that has experienced deforestation. On the ground lay remnants of trees. In the background, there is a forest with pine trees.">
          <p class="focusDesc">Habitat destruction is another important factor to consider when learning about environmentalism because of the ways that it acts with climate change to decrease biodiversity and species abundance. Habitat destruction is the process by which a natural habitat becomes incapable of supporting its original species, and it can be caused by harvesting fossil fuels, deforestation, urbanization, natural disasters, and global warming. It is the leading cause of biodiversity loss and contributes greatly to the current mass extinction.</p>
