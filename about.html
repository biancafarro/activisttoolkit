      <h3 id="aboutMain">Thank you for visiting my website!</h3>
      <p id="aboutPara">Hi! My name is Bianca and I created this website during the Summer Immersion Program at Girls Who Code. I was motivated to make this website because of my passions for environmentalism and sustainability and my desires to help others learn more about current issues in environmentalism. I care deeply about environmentalism, climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction because of the way that they affects every being on Earth, and I truly believe in the importance of taking care of the beautiful planet that we live on.</p>
